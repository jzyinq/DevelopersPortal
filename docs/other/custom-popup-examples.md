# Custom popup examples

## Introduction

Since version 10.1 of PPAS there is a possiblity of creating a
<span class="title-ref">Custom popup</span> tag template. To add one,
head to <span class="title-ref">Tag Manager</span> and while on
<span class="title-ref">Tags</span> tab, choose
<span class="title-ref">+ Crate new tag</span>. From there you can
select <span class="title-ref">Custom popup</span> template. Once added,
you will be greated by default template code which consists of overlay,
popup box and close button. To highlight what can be created with the
use of this template, we decided to share some example implementations
that can be further modified and expanded.

## Example 1

Example code:

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="html">

popup-examples/example-popup-1.html

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Handling of the close button is provided out of the box, as long as the
class name `ppms-popup-close-button` is unchanged. Your own JavaScript
code to handle <span class="title-ref">Subscribe now</span> button needs
to be provided.

</div>
